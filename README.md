# Side-Learn

Express, Node.js and MongoDB CRUD application.
User accounts are authenticated securely with Passport.js and Json web tokens.
I designed the view with Bootstrap and Handlebars.

This is a basic things-to-do list CRUD application for keeping track of learning goals. 
Users create an account and are taken to a dashboard where they can view or add to their list of goals.

I built this to have a go at learning a template engine and server-side rendering. 

I actively use this to capture and list all the side projects and reading which I plan 
to do to supplement the Thinkful coding boot-camp curriculum.
